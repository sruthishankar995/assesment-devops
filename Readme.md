📌 Context

This repository represents a modernization plan for an existing startup application stack.

"Current State"

Single monolithic repository

React frontend

Python backend

Bash deployment scripts

Runs on EC2 instances in AWS

Uses PostgreSQL RDS

Uses S3 for object storage

Manual deployments via SSH

No CI/CD

No Infrastructure as Code

No centralized logging

Minimal monitoring via AWS console dashboards

Load spikes cause:

High memory usage → swap thrashing

Database overload due to bulk writes

Slowdowns and occasional downtime

🎯 Goals (6–12 Month Plan)

Eliminate manual deployments

Introduce Infrastructure as Code

Improve scalability and reliability

Handle load spikes safely

Reduce downtime

Improve observability

Support future growth

🧱 Technology Choices
Container Orchestration: Amazon EKS

Why Kubernetes (EKS) instead of ECS?

Fine-grained autoscaling (CPU + memory)

Independent scaling for worker pods

Strong ecosystem

Future microservices flexibility

Advanced deployment strategies (Blue/Green, Canary)

EKS provides long-term scalability and flexibility for a growing startup.

🗺 Migration Plan (Minimizing Downtime)
Phase 1 (Months 0–3): Stabilization & Foundations

Highest Priority

Introduce Terraform for infrastructure

Containerize frontend and backend

Implement GitHub Actions CI/CD

Centralized logging (CloudWatch)

Basic autoscaling on EC2

This reduces operational risk immediately.

Phase 2 (Months 3–6): Platform Migration

Deploy EKS cluster

Deploy workloads to EKS

Implement ALB Ingress

Introduce Blue/Green deployments

Gradually shift traffic from EC2 to EKS

Downtime minimized by:

Running EC2 and EKS in parallel

Gradually shifting traffic using ALB weighted routing

Phase 3 (Months 6–12): Scalability & Resilience

Migrate RDS → Aurora PostgreSQL

Introduce SQS for heavy background tasks

Deploy autoscaling worker pods

Implement HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)

Add Redis caching

Implement advanced observability

⚡ Handling Load Spikes
Current Problem

Large client jobs:

Consume high memory

Overload database

Block API threads

Cause downtime

Proposed Solution: Async Task Processing

Instead of:

Client → API → Heavy Processing → DB


We move to:

Client → API → SQS → Worker Pods → DB

Benefits

API remains responsive

Workers scale independently

Controlled database load

No memory thrashing in API pods

🗄 Database Scalability Strategy
1️⃣ Migrate to Aurora PostgreSQL

Benefits:

Better performance

Auto storage scaling

Read replicas

Faster failover

2️⃣ Read Replicas
Writes → Primary
Reads → Replica


Reduces primary database load.

3️⃣ Bulk Insert Optimization

Use batch inserts

Use COPY for large data loads

Optimize autovacuum

Partition large tables

4️⃣ Connection Pooling

Introduce:

RDS Proxy
or

PgBouncer

Prevents connection storms during load spikes.

🔍 Observability Improvements

Introduce full three-pillar observability:

Logs

Application logs → CloudWatch

Metrics

Prometheus

CloudWatch metrics

ALB and RDS monitoring

Tracing

AWS X-Ray

Alerts

SNS → Slack / Email

Alerts for:

High memory

High DB CPU

High 5xx errors

SQS queue backlog

🔄 CI/CD Modernization

Replace manual SSH deployments with GitHub Actions:

Pipeline Flow

Run tests

Build Docker image

Push to ECR

Deploy to EKS

Blue/Green traffic shift

Automatic rollback on failure

Benefits

No manual deployments

Zero-downtime releases

Safer rollouts

Faster iteration

🔐 Security Improvements

IAM Roles for Service Accounts

Private subnets for EKS nodes

Secrets Manager for credentials

Encrypted RDS storage

WAF in front of ALB

VPC Endpoints for S3


📈 What Gets Done First
